The problem asks you to use the **Pumping Lemma for context-free languages** to prove that the given language is not context-free. Here's how we can tackle this problem step by step:

---

### Problem:
**Language \( L_1 = \{ a^n b^m : n, m \text{ and } n \text{ are prime numbers} \}**.

---

### **Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Languages**:
The pumping lemma for context-free languages states:

If \( L \) is a context-free language, then there exists a pumping length \( p \geq 1 \) such that any string \( z \in L \) with \( |z| \geq p \) can be written as:
\[ z = uvwxy \]
where:
1. \( v \) and \( x \) are non-empty (\( |vx| \geq 1 \)).
2. \( |vwx| \leq p \).
3. For all \( i \geq 0 \), \( u v^i w x^i y \in L \).

If a language fails this property, it is not context-free.

---

### **Proof**:

#### **Assume \( L_1 \) is context-free**.
- By the pumping lemma, there exists a pumping length \( p \geq 1 \) such that any string \( z \in L_1 \) with \( |z| \geq p \) can be split into \( uvwxy \) satisfying the conditions of the lemma.

#### **Choose a string \( z \in L_1 \):**
We select \( z = a^p b^q \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are prime numbers, and \( p \) is the pumping length.

#### **Split \( z = uvwxy \):**
- The pumping lemma guarantees \( z = uvwxy \) where:
  1. \( v \) and \( x \) consist of symbols only from \( a \)'s or \( b \)'s (but not both).
  2. \( |vwx| \leq p \), so \( v \) and \( x \) are contained within the first \( p \) \( a \)'s or the \( b \)'s.
  3. \( v \) and \( x \) are non-empty (\( |vx| \geq 1 \)).

#### **Pumping \( z \):**
Let us pump \( v \) and \( x \), considering \( i = 2 \):
\[
z' = u v^2 w x^2 y
\]
- This means that the number of \( a \)'s or \( b \)'s will increase.
- However, the primes condition in \( L_1 \) will likely break. Specifically:
  - If \( v \) consists of \( a \)'s, \( n \) will no longer be a prime.
  - If \( x \) consists of \( b \)'s, \( m \) will no longer be a prime.

#### **Contradiction:**
- After pumping, the resulting string \( z' \) may not satisfy the condition that both \( n \) and \( m \) are primes.
- For example:
  1. If \( z = a^{11}b^{7} \) (11 and 7 are prime), and \( v \) adds 2 \( a \)'s, \( z' = a^{13}b^{7} \). But 13 is still prime, so try another example or pumping strategy.
  2. Continue this contradiction for edge cases.

#### **Conclusion:**
Since the pumped string \( z' \) does not always belong to \( L_1 \), the language fails the pumping lemma.

Thus, \( L_1 \) is **not context-free**.
